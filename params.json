  "body": "# Introduction\r\n**BRICK** is a bounded reachability checker for numericallyintensive C code, with special emphasis on handling nonlinear operations. It supports user-speciﬁed safety speciﬁcation checking as well as built-in assertion and domain error checking. \r\n\r\nDiﬀerent from the existing tools, **BRICK** supports the checking of codes with nonlinear operations. e.g. trigonometric functions, exponential functions by delta-decision SMT solver dReal. At the same time, **BRICK** supports inter-procedural analysis, and analysis of complex structures including arrays, structs, and pointer registers. **BRICK** has scaled well on realistic programs in evaluation, e.g. for debugging the GNU Scientiﬁc Library (GSL).\r\n\r\nThe functionalities of **BRICK** are shown from the following command in the standard unix command-line style:     \r\n`BRICK < filename > -f < func > -b < bound > -p < precision > [-options]`.\r\n\r\n**BRICK** returns the error type and line number if a error would ocurr. It also shows the inputs that trigger it.\r\n\r\n# Experiment\r\nWe evaluate **BRICK** on functions of specfunc in the GNU scientiﬁc library ([GSL](http://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/gsl.html)), which is a mature and widely-used numerically-intensive scientiﬁc library. Furthermore, we locate one similar projects Numerical Algorithms in ALGOL ([NUMAL](https://github.com/JeffBezanson/numal)) library in C in github.\r\n\r\n## Benchmark\r\n* GSL \r\n* NUMAL\r\n\r\n## Results\r\nThe output and statics of experiment:\r\n* [GSL](https://github.com/BRICK-tool/Experiment/tree/master/GSL)\r\n* [NUMAL](https://github.com/BRICK-tool/Experiment/tree/master/numal)\r\n\r\n# Building Instruction\r\n## Binary Release\r\nPlease vist the [Binary at GitHub].(https://github.com/BRICK-tool/BRICK_binary).\r\nUse `./Build_BRICK.sh` before using the binary.\r\n\r\n## Source Code and Build Instructions\r\nYou can download the source code of BRICK.
